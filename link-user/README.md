## Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a development environment that helps developers move faster.
It removes the networking aspect of front-end programming and lets developers quickly iterate on visual tweaks
and state transitions.

`npm run storybook` will boot the app and watch for changes throughout the `src` directory. Read the [docs](https://storybook.js.org/)
and write a `WhateverComponent.stories.js` file to showcase and test your cool UI.
