We should explore the OpenReferral data format

Make it easy to community organizations to 

Make services (and info)  easily accessible (available).
(Service is something that can provide help with a problem)
(Easily = they can find it without needing to go through another entity). 

Make it easy for groups to inform folks of these services

Provide community organization a platform to provide information
(Remove technical barriers to provide information.) 

Advocate for open data standards and terms
