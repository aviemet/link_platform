### Architectural Decision Records

The tool for managing architectual decision records is adr-tools. 
It stanadardizes the process for adding records and templates for the record format.
The github repo is:
`https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools`

But I installed it using brew:
`brew install adr-tools`
