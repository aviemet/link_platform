# 12. Use Jest and Enzyme for unit testing

Date: 2018-06-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Use Jest and Enzyme to unit test the React application. Jest is a general JavaScript testing framework. Enzyme is a testing utility that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse React components.

## Decision

To add Jest and Enzyme to the project.

## Consequences

The tests will slow down development but will guide implementation and ensure that the platform has reduced logical bugs and correctly renders components.
